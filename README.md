## tree

A tree command with only the options and parameters and defaults that I like.

This is a port of [my C version](https://github.com/ltriant/tree) to [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/), as a way to try out the Nim language.

## Build & Install

Requires the [Nim toolchain](https://nim-lang.org/) to build.

```
$ nimble build
```

This will build a `tree` executable. To install it to your Nimble directory (defaults to `~/.nimble/bin`):

```
$ nimble install
```
